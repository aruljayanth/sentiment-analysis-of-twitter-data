The aim of this project is to implement an automated model that can analyse a given text and label the respective sentiment associated with it in an accurate manner. This project deals with interpretation and classification of emotions (positive and negative) within text data using text analysis techniques on dynamically generated dataset using machine learning models. Using an automated model like this for sentiment analysis helps businesses process huge amounts of data in an efficient and cost-effective way. It can even help social platforms to analyse the opinions of its community in an efficient way and develop itself accordingly.
